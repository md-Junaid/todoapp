# todoapp

After downloading the app, use command line to install all dependencies by typing npm install.
Also install nodemon by typing npm install -g nodemon.
After installing nodemon and dependencies, type nodemon in command line or git bash which will host this app to port 3000,
open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Front end was done using Angular.Js and backend with Node.js, the backend code is messy but its still working.
IMPORTANT NOTE: This web app is still under development and I will add some new features. This web app was developed for a full stack hiring challange conducted by clevero on hackerearth.com. Although the challange has completed but I will finish the project.
